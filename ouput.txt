           Data monetization   From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia   Jump to navigation   search   Data monetization  a form of  monetization  is generating  revenue  from available data sources or real time streamed data by instituting the discovery capture storage analysis dissemination and use of that data Said differently it is the process by which data producers data aggregators and data consumers large and small exchange sell or trade data Data monetization leverages data generated through business operations as well as data associated with individual actors and with electronic devices and sensors participating in the  internet of things  The ubiquity of the  internet of things  is generating  location data  and other data from sensors and  mobile devices  at an ever increasing rate When this data is collated against traditional databases the value and utility of both sources of data increases leading to tremendous potential to mine data for social good research and discovery and achievement of business objectives Closely associated with data monetization are the emerging  data as a service  models for transactions involving data by the data item  There are three  ethical  and regulatory vectors involved in data monetization due to the sometimes conflicting interests of actors involved in the  data supply chain  The individual data creator who generates files and records through his own efforts or owns a device such as a sensor or a mobile phone that generates data has a claim to ownership of data The business entity that generates data in the course of its operations such as its transactions with financial institutions or  risk factors  discovered through feedback from customers also has a claim on data captured through their systems and platforms However the person that contributed the data may also have a legitimate claim on the data Internet platforms and service providers such as  Google  or  Facebook  that require a user to forgo some ownership interest in their data in exchange for use of the platform also have a legitimate claim on the data Thus the practice of data monetization although common since 2000 is now getting increasing attention from regulators The  European Union  and the  United States Congress  have begun to address these issues For instance in the financial services industry regulations involving data are included in the  GrammLeachBliley Act  and  DoddFrank  Some individual creators of data are shifting to using  personal data vaults 1  and implementing  vendor relationship management 2  concepts as a reflection of an increasing resistance to their data being federated or aggregated and resold without compensation Groups such as the  Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium  3   Patient Privacy Rights  4  and others are also challenging corporate cooptation of data without compensation  Financial services  companies are a relatively good example of an industry focused on generating revenue by leveraging data  Credit card  issuers and  retail banks  use customer transaction data to improve targeting of  crosssell  offers Partners are increasingly promoting merchant based  reward programs  which leverage a banks data and provide discounts to customers at the same time     Contents    1   Steps  2   Pricing Variables and Factors  3   Benefits  4   Frameworks  5   Examples  6

other transmission service for uploading and downloading data  sometimes for an individual through a  personal cloud  A price or exchange or other trade value assigned by a data creator or generator to a data item or a data source  A price or exchange or other trade value offered by a data buyer to a data creator  A price or exchange or other trade value assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data source formatted according to criteria set by a data buyer  An incremental fee assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data set scaled to the reputation of the data creator  A fee for use of encrypted keys to achieve secure data transfer  A fee for use of a search algorithm specifically designed to tag data sources that contain data points of value to the data buyer  A fee for linking a data creator or generator to a data collection protocol or form  A fee for server actions  such as a notification  triggered by an update to a data item or data source included into a data supply chain   IT Research firm  Gartner  has developed and published proprietary models for quantifying the value of data  Why and How to Measure the Value of Your Information Assets  for quantifying informations value that can be useful in pricing data or determining its overall economic value This is part of Gartners  infonomics  research led by Doug Laney  Benefits  edit    Improved decisionmaking that leads to  real time   crowd sourced  research improved profits decreased costs reduced risk and improved compliance  More impactful decisions eg make real time decisions  More timely lower latency decisions eg a vendor making purchase recommendations while the customer is still on the phone or in the store a customer connecting with multiple vendors to discover a best price triggered notifications when thresholds are reached for data values   More granular decisions eg localized pricing decisions at an individual or device or sensor level versus larger aggregates   Frameworks  edit   There are a wide variety of industries firms and business models related to data monetization The following frameworks have been offered to help understand the types of business models that are used  Doug Laney of  Gartner  a leading IT research and advisory firm has posited a model for a range of data monetization methods   Indirect Data Monetization  Using data to improve efficiencies  Using data to measurably reduce risks  Using data to develop new products markets  Using data to build and solidify partner relationships  Publishing Branded indices    Direct Data Monetization  Bartering or trading with information  Informationenhanced products or services  Selling raw data through brokers  Offering datareport subscriptions     He also suggests a set of feasibility tests and questions for any data monetization ideas being considered    Type of Feasibility  Feasibility Question    Practical  Is the idea utilitarian or merely interestingcool Is it usable    Marketable  Would the idea have sufficiently broad appeal internally or externally    Scalable  Can the idea be developed and implemented to the extent required or intended    Manageable  Do you have the skills to oversee the development  implementation of the idea    Technological  Do you have the tools information and skills to develop and rollout the idea    Economical  Will the idea require too much investment or generate sufficient return on investment    Legal  Does the idea conform to local laws where it will be used or implemented    Ethical  Will the idea be something that has the potential for customeruserpublic backlash    Example  Will the idea cause significant positive vs negative impact on the environment    Roger Ehrenberg of IA Ventures a VC firm that invests in this space has defined three basic types of data product firms    Contributory databases  The magic of these businesses is that a customer provides their own data in exchange for receiving a more robust set of aggregated data back that provides insight into the broader marketplace or provides a vehicle for expressing a view Give a little get a lot back in return  a pretty compelling value proposition and one that frequently results in a payment from the data contributor in exchange for receiving enriched aggregated data Once these contributory databases are developed and customers become reliant on their insights they become extremely valuable and persistent data assets  Data processing platforms  These businesses create barriers through a combination of complex data architectures proprietary algorithms and rich analytics to help customers consume data in whatever form they please Often these businesses have special relationships with key data providers that when combined with other data and processed as a whole create valuable differentiation and competitive barriers Bloomberg is an example of a powerful data processing platform They pull in data from a wide array of sources including their own home grown data integrate it into a unified stream make it consumable via a dashboard or through an API and offer a robust analytics suite for a staggering number of use cases Needless to say their scale and profitability is the envy of the industry  Data creation platforms  These businesses solve vexing problems for large numbers of users and by their nature capture a broad swath of data from their customers As these data sets grow they become increasingly valuable in enabling companies to better tailor their products and features and to target customers with highly contextual and relevant offers Customers dont sign up to directly benefit from the data asset the product is so valuable that they simply want the features offered outofthebox As the product gets better over time it just cements the lockin of what is already a successful platform Mint was an example of this kind of business People saw value in the core product But the product continued to get better as more customer data was collected and analyzed There werent network effects per se but the sheer scale of the data asset that was created was an essential element of improving the product over time 5   Selvanathan and Zuk  6  offer a framework that includes monetization methods that are outside the bounds of the traditional value capture systems employed by an enterprise tuned to match the context and consumption models for the target customer They offer examples of four distinct approaches platforms applications dataasaservice and professional services  Ethan McCallum and Ken Gleason published an ORielly eBook titled  Business Models for the Data Economy   CollectSupply  StoreHost  FilterRefine  EnhanceEnrich  Simplify Access  Analyze  Obscure  ConsultAdvise 7   Examples  edit    Packaging of data with analytics to be resold to customers for things such as wallet share  market share  and  benchmarking  Integration of data with analytics into new products as a valueadded differentiator such as  OnStar  for  General Motors  cars  GPS  enabled  smartphones  Geolocation based offers and location discounts such as those offered by  Facebook 8  and  Groupon 9  are other prime examples of data monetization leveraging new emerging channels  CRM based ad targeting and media attribution such as those offered by Circulate   Intellectual property landscape  edit   Some of the patents issued since 2010 by the  USPTO  for monetizing data generated by individuals include 8271346 8612307 8560464 8510176 and 7860760 These are usually in the class 705 related to electronic commerce data processing and cost and price determination Some of these patents use the term the  data supply chain  to reflect emerging technology to federate and aggregate data in real time from many individuals and devices linked together through the  internet of things  Another emerging term is  information banking   An unexplored but potentially disruptive arena for data monetization is the use of  Bitcoin micropayments  for data transactions Because Bitcoins are emerging as competitors with payment services like Visa or PayPal that can readily enable and reduce or eliminate transaction costs transactions for as little as a single data item can be facilitated Consumers as well as enterprises who desire to monetize their participation in a data supply chain may soon be able to access social network enabled Bitcoin exchanges and platforms 10   Clickbait  and data hijacking may wither as micropayments for data are ubiquitous and enabled Potentially even the current need to build out data broker managed data trading exchanges may be bypassed Stanley Smith 11  who introduced the notion of the data supply chain has said that simple micropayments for data monetization are the key to evolution of ubiquitous implementation of user configurable data supply schemata enabling data monetization on a universal scale for all data creators including the

new or prospective clients inquire about how we analysts specifically are helping business and technology leaders accelerate and improve their information and analytics related capabilities Well as part of Gartners new Data Strategy research team here are just some of the topics that have been keeping me busy researching speaking on and advising clients   Collaborating with clients economists and accountants on ways to quantify the economic value of information assets including the development of models and internal balance sheets for reporting on these values Several clients are using the approaches we have developed to prioritize information management initiatives business initiatives data governancequality efforts and determining which exogenous data sources to incorporate into their own data streams    Identifying dozens of ways to monetize their own information assets andor those that can be captured and collected externally    Developing business cases and guidance on how to become a more infocentricinfosavvy organization    Developing and coaching on our approach to innovating with information    Defining how to apply traditional asset management principles and practices eg from financial or material asset management to the discipline of information asset management    Researching the economics of information or what we have coined infonomics This includes a study that that identified how information centric organizations are rewarded significantly by financial markets over and above their peers    Helping some of the late adopters appreciate the value challenges and strategy essentials of Big Data    Inspiring clients with realworld ideas for innovating with information and analytics from our growing library of hundreds of cool examples    Selecting among a variety of organizational and staffing models for data sciencedata scientistsadvanced analytics And identifying specifically and empirically how the role of the data scientist differs from those of the business intelligence analyst or statistician    Expanding the scope of information governance to include the concept of or even be rebranded as information advocacy    Comprehensively researching and defining the role of the chief data officer and providing training and ongoing guidance for new CDOs    Identifying dozens of key attributes for a highfunctioning analytic center of excellence ACE    Ongoing reviews enhancements and guidance on clients data strategy planning and other related documents    Researching the state of the marketplace for data brokers  methods and sites for selling or publishing data    Enumerating the various benefits and risks of open data consumption and publication and how to go about doing distributing and accessing open data    Also I continue to develop and deliver workshops on our Information Maturity Model guided selfassessment and recommendations and Information Innovation generating and testing the feasibility of ideas for innovating with informationanalytics   As information is increasingly recognized as an organizations most critical and differentiating yet underutilized asset we contend that

things For many the price of a companys stock is meant to bakein all the publicly available information concerning that firms potential for future returns or lack thereof on investment This is market efficiency  But the stock market also operates assuming  noise  It is  noise  that creates uncertainty and this allows for winners and losers to emerge For the market to exist winners have to emerge else there is no point playing And for winners to emerge some non winners also have to exist  If you imagine that all buyers and sellers had  perfect information  and all trading could be executed  instantaneously  and  failry  there would be no stock market In effect perfection would define everyone a winner and a loser at the same time It is because   It takes time for information to be absorbed by the market andor  Information itself offers asymmetrical value to the consumer   that markets work at all This is one reason why an amateur day trader will most often not out perform a professional trading firm I dont talk about the absolute here I refer to the most likely outcomes  So we need to understand the  time displacement  and the  value  assimilation  asymmetry  The former is a major technical challenge of today that can be resolved The latter is more of a theoretical concern that is hard to agree define and account for    Category  economy

Gartner Blog Network         Back to GBN Home          Tweet        To Twitter Youre worth 10170  by  Doug Laney    November 12 2013     Submit a Comment   Prior to Facebooks IPO I published a piece in the Wall Street Journal suggesting what the economic value of one of its active users was at the time  To Facebook Youre Worth 8095  So why not reprise the concept by exploring the  infonomics  of  Twitter   Twitters  S1 IPO filing  reports that there are over 500 million tweets per day from 215 million active users Thats about 900some tweets per user per year Over 1000 tweets per year Consider yourself above average Twitters S1 balance sheet identifies 964 million in assets and as of this writing  TWTR s market cap is 2283 billion  As I argued in the  WSJ piece  since companies like Facebook and Twitter are nearly pure informationbased businesses the difference between their market cap and reported assets represents the value of their information assets Or more precisely  current investor expectations of Twitters ability to monetize its data expressed in net present dollars  This means the value of Twitters data is 2186 billion assuming a yearlong valuable life expectancy of a tweet True tweets are not easily searchable after a few days on the wire but this doesnt mean theyre not without value to Twitter  Note Due to arcane and archaic accounting practices dating back to the Great Depression then reinforced in the aftermath of the 911 terrorist attacks information assets are not considered corporate assets and therefore are nowhere to be found on balance sheets of any company For more on this see my piece  Infonomics The New Economics of Information  in the Financial Times or my Gartner research note  The Birth of Infonomics and the New Economics of Information    So with 215 million active users this means that each one of us as of this writing is worth 10170 to Twitter In terms of revenue however we generate a scant 147 per year for Twitter Each measly tweet itself is worth 12 cents and generates 17 onethousandths of a cent 00017 in revenue  How does Twitter monetize its data Today mostly via advertising revenue 8587 according to its S1 It delivers 2 billion tweets per day to desktops and mobile devices so theres plenty of room to slip in some ads Twitter also has special deals with others to provide access to the  Twitter Firehose  full data stream and resell its content As I suggested in my previous Gartner Blog Network piece  Twitters Secret Nest Egg is in Plain Sight  ultimately Twitter will shift to syndicating its data over advertising as a primary source of revenue   Sure Twitter and Facebook are extreme cases with extreme numbers to go along with them Still consider the vast amount of data your organization collects that if sanitized packaged and marketed effectively could introduce an entire new revenue stream for youperhaps even selffunding your ongoing enterprise data warehouse or nascent big data initiative

this morning actually yesterday Yet another end user organization said to me It was just 6 months after our project ERP migration that we discovered we had lost control of our data and it started to materially impact our ability to perform This phrase and many like it is very common What isnt as common is the 6 month number I get the feeling the average is actually 9 months though there are a few around or even less than 6 months Some limp along after 12 months and continue towards oblivious without realizing how useful consistent information is to critical business performance  So is this figure 3 6 or 9 months a kind of information utility half life What factors would dictate the time it takes before something hits the fan Would a manufactures so called information usefulness half life differ from an insurance organization What about a firm that actually sells information  would that be even more dependent on information usefulness or utility What about the size and complexity of the application landscape  I would imagine this has a factor also I am sure there are others What do you think  I had another idea some time ago related to information fitness  Fitness  is a term used very specifically in evolutionary theory and I am intrigued with the idea of applying the concept to information Too often the term data quality is thrown out there as a broad umbrella to mean a lot of different things Some others use the term fidelity and so they wrap quality under it For those that use data quality the term fidelity might be an element of it But fitness seems to be a good new word to cover all known and even known unknown elements of quality and fidelity and overall persistence of value over time Some questions   How long does value in information persist  How can we account for its value if its own utility usefullness quality or fitness falls  Does the value curve fall at the same rate as the fitness curve  How does informatin fitness change and how is it changed once information assets are combined think bills of material   All good questions  right Even better to discuss over a beer  perhaps we can explore at our upcoming Enterprise Information and Master Data Management Summits   London UK  httpwwwgartnercomtechnologysummitsemeadatamanagementnicamvemeamdm  Las Vegas USA  httpwwwgartnercomtechnologysummitsnamasterdatamanagement     Category

Thoughts on Does Information Utility suffer a Half Life       Does Information Utility suffer a Half Life  All that Cuteness   says    January 29 2014 at 907 am     By Andrew White          Dennis Moore   says    January 30 2014 at 640 pm    Andrew   Great insight as usual  As Ford Goodman often says data degrades  However not all data degrades at the same rate  For example many people now keep the same personal email address and personal phone number for their entire lives but their work email address and work phone number may change much more frequently  Last names of American men change less frequently than last names of European men and both change less frequently than last names of American women  Home addresses change as well as do the members of your household  Data may not have a strict utilityetime half life function and the utility may vary significantly by source  Your field sales force may know that an important customer has changed address long before your purchased third party data source is aware  Your purchased third party data source however may be aware much sooner of a negative change in a key customers or suppliers credit rating than does your field sales force  Clearly the utility of data declines with time but that time factor is different for different data elements and it varies by source  A more recent update in a less trusted source may be more trustworthy than a very old update in a normally trustworthy source  Master data management systems should be able to factor data element data source and time into an easily configured fitness calculator that produces the best version of the truth for the business  Thanks for another thoughtprovoking blog   Dennis Moore Informatica         Andrew White   says    February 6 2014 at 1016 am    Hi Dennis thanks for the response and post  I wanted to call out an item you mentioned Clearly the utility of data declines with time  I suspect some analysts would believe that information utility surely does NOT decline with time  Or more precisely some information utility may decline over time  Some information utility may actually increase with time  If I knew a secret the winner of a horse race next week the utility of that information should fluctuate but once the race has finished the utility of that information drops to zero  It might even go negative if I bother to store and keep that data in short term memory  due to opportunity cost  So this whole discussion about what value information is a fun one to explore  It never is black and white I think  But your response is spot on  and I agree with your points overall Andrew      Comments are closed            Become a Client  Call us now at  1 8002134848  or  Contact us online     TRENDING TOPICS   Trends  Predictions
