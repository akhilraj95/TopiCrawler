He took office as the Prime Minister after the  2014 general election  in which his party BJP won a majority in the  Lok Sabha  the lower house of the Indian parliament for the first time since 1984 general elections. 3  As Prime Minister Modis administration has focused on reforming and modernising Indias infrastructure and government 4  reducing bureaucracy encouraging increased foreign direct investment 5  improving national standards of health and sanitation and  improving foreign relations . 6 7  Earlier as Chief Minister of Gujarat Modis economic policies credited with encouraging economic growth in Gujarat have been praised 8  although his administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve the human development in the state and for failing to prevent the  2002 Gujarat riots . 9 10 11  A  Hindu nationalist  and member of the  Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  RSS Modi remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally. 9 12 13 14 15 16 17     Contents    1   Early life and education  2   Early political career 19752001  3   Chief Minister of Gujarat 200114   3.1   First term 200102  3.2   2002 Gujarat riots   3.2.1   2002 election    3.3   Second term 200207   3.3.1   2007 election    3.4   Third term 200712   3.4.1   Projects  3.4.2   Development debate    3.5   Fourth term 201214  3.6   International diplomacy    4   2014 Indian general election  5   Prime Minister 2014present   5.1   Economic policies  5.2   Health and sanitation policies  5.3   Environmental policies  5.4   Defence policy  5.5   IT policy  5.6   International diplomacy    6   Personal life  7   Image  8   Books  9   Awards and recognition   9.1   State honours    10   References   10.1   Notes  10.2   Citations  10.3   Sources    11   Further reading  12   External links     Early life and education  Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in  Vadnagar   Mehsana district   Bombay State  presentday Gujarat. He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi. 18  Modis family belonged to the  Modh  Ghanchi  Teli  oilpresser community 19 20 21 22  which is categorised as an  Other Backward Class  by the Indian government. 22 23  As a child Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. 24 25  Modi completed his  higher secondary education  in Vadnagar in 1967 where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater with an interest in theatre. 24  Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates and this was noted by his teachers and students. 26  Modi preferred playing largerthanlife characters in theatrical productions which has influenced his political image. 27 28     Modi with his mother Hiraben on his 63rd birthday on 17 September 2013.    At age eight Modi discovered the  Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  RSS and began attending its local  shakhas  training sessions. There Modi met  Lakshmanrao Inamdar  popularly known as Vakil Saheb who inducted him as a  balswayamsevak  junior cadet for RSS and became his political mentor. 29  While Modi was training with the RSS he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda  Bharatiya Jana Sangh  leaders who were founding members of the BJPs Gujarat unit in 1980. 30 31  Engaged while still a child to a local girl  Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi  Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school. 32  The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967. 33  Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and Northeastern India though few details of where he went have emerged. 34  In interviews Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by  Swami Vivekananda  the  Belur Math  near  Kolkata  followed by the  Advaita Ashrama  in  Almora  and the  Ramakrishna Mission  in  Rajkot . Modi remained only a short time at each since he lacked the required college education. 35 36 37  Modis life is said to have Vivekanandas deep influence. People close to Modi have often been quoted saying that Modi has molded many aspects of his life as Vivekanandas. 38  Reaching the Belur Math in the early summer of 1968 and being turned away Modi wandered through Calcutta West Bengal and Assam stopping by Siliguri and Guwahati. 39  Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora where he was again rejected before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 196869. 40  Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970 Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for  Ahmedabad . 41  There Modi lived with his uncle working in the latters canteen at the  Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation . 42 43  In Ahmedabad Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar who was based at Hedgewar Bhavan RSS headquarters in the city. 44 45 46  After the  IndoPakistani War of 1971  he stopped working for his uncle and became a fulltime  pracharak  campaigner for the RSS. 43  In 1978 Modi became an RSS  sambhag pracharak  regional organiser and received a degree in  Political Science  after a  distanceeducation  course from  Delhi University . 47 48  Five years later he received a  Master of Arts  degree in political science from  Gujarat University  in 1982. 49 50  Early political career 19752001  On 26 June 1975 Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi  declared a  state of emergency  in India which lasted until 1977. During this period many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups including the RSS were banned. 51 52  As  pracharak incharge  of the  Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad  ABVP the student wing of the RSS Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. 24 53 54 55  During this period Modi wrote a book in  Gujarati   Sangharsh ma Gujarat   The Struggles of Gujarat  describing events during the Emergency. 56 57  He was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. 30  In 1988 Modi was elected organising secretary of the partys Gujarat unit marking his entrance into electoral politics. 47 58  He rose within the party helping organise  L. K. Advani s 1990  Ram Rath Yatra  in 1990 and  Murli Manohar Joshi s 199192  Ekta Yatra  Journey for Unity. 24 59  As party secretary Modis electoral strategy was considered central to BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections. 30 60 61  In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and  Himachal Pradesh . 60 62  The following year  Shankersinh Vaghela  one of the most prominent BJP leaders in Gujarat defected to the INC after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections. 24  Modi on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat favoured supporters of BJP leader  Keshubhai Patel  over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections 60 63  and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary organisation in May of that year. 64  Chief Minister of Gujarat 200114     Chief Minister Modi and his  cabinet ministers  at a  Planning Commission  meeting in New Delhi 2013.    In 2001 Patels health was failing and the BJP had lost seats in the  byelections . Allegations of abuse of power corruption and poor administration were made and Patels standing had been damaged by his administrations handling of the  2001 Bhuj earthquake . 60 65 66  The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for chief minister and Modi who had expressed misgivings about Patels administration was chosen as a replacement. 24  Although Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modis lack of experience in government Modi declined an offer to be Patels deputy chief minister and told Advani and  Atal Bihari Vajpayee  he was going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all. On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. 67 68  As Chief Minister Modi favoured privatisation and  small government  this was at odds with political commentator  Aditi Phadnis  description of the RSS as antiprivatisation and antiglobalisation. 65  First term 200102  On 7 October 2001 Modi was administered the oath of office. 69  On 24 February 2002 he won a  byelection  to the Rajkot  II assembly constituency defeating Ashwin Mehta of the  Indian National Congress  INC by 14728 votes. 70  2002 Gujarat riots  Main article  2002 Gujarat riots  On 27 February 2002 a train with several hundred passengers was  burned near Godhra  killing approximately 60 people. a  The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished  Babri Masjid . 73 74  In making a public statement after the incident Modi said that the attack had been preplanned terror attack by local Muslims. 73 75 76  The next day the  Vishwa Hindu Parishad  called for a  bandh  across the state. 77 78  Riots began during the  bandh  and  antiMuslim violence  spread through Gujarat. 73 77 78  The governments decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad had the effect of further inflaming the violence. 73 79  The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed. 80  Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000. 73 81  Approximately 150000 people were driven to refugee camps. 82  Numerous women and children were among the victims the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women. 83  The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots 75 83 84  and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. 85  Several scholars have described the violence as a  pogrom  while others have called it an example of  state terrorism . 86 87 88  Summarising academic views on the subject  Martha Nussbaum  said There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing that in many ways it was premeditated and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law. 83  The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities issued shootatsight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating. 77 78  The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the  bandh  despite such actions being illegal at the time. 75  State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. 89  Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. 90  During the riots police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. 76 83 91  In 2012  Maya Kodnani  a minister in Modis government from 2007 to 2009 was convicted of participation in the  Naroda Patiya massacre  during the 2002 riots. 92 93  Although Modis government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal it reversed its decision in 2013. 94 95  Modis personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots Modi said that What is happening is a chain of action and reaction. 83  Later in 2002 Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode. 96  He subsequently claimed that some journalists at Indias  NDTV  channel had acted irresponsibly in their coverage of the events. 97  In March 2008 the  Supreme Court  reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots including that of the  Gulbarg Society massacre  and established a Special Investigation Team SIT to look into the issue. 85 98 99  In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri widow of  Ehsan Jafri  who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modis complicity in the killings. 98  The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010 in May it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against Modi. 98 100  In July 2011 the courtappointed  amicus curiae   Raju Ramachandran  submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SITs position he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence. 101 102  The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate court. The SIT examined Ramachandrans report and in March 2012 submitted its final report asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate court rejected the protest petition accepting the SITs finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister. 103  2002 election  Main article  Gujarat Legislative Assembly election 2002  In the aftermath of the violence came widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state including leaders of the  Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam  and the  Telugu Desam Party  allies in the BJPled  National Democratic Alliance  coalition and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. 104  Modi submitted his resignation which was not accepted at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa. 105  His cabinet had a 19 July 2002 emergency meeting offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari and the assembly was dissolved. 106 107  In the subsequent elections the BJP won 127 seats in the 182member assembly. 108  Although Modi later denied it he made significant use of antiMuslim rhetoric during his campaign. 109 110 111 112  He won the Maninagar constituency receiving 113589 of 154981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75333 votes. 113  On 22 December 2002 Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. 114  Second term 200207     Modi with Prime Minister  Atal Bihari Vajpayee  in 2002.    After accusations of antiMuslim rhetoric during the campaign during Modis second term his emphasis shifted from  Hindutva  to Gujarats economic development. 65 109  He curtailed the influence of  Sangh Parivar  organisations such as the  Bharatiya Kisan Sangh  BKS and the  Vishva Hindu Parishad  VHP 115  entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabads textile industry 65  and dropped  Gordhan Zadafia  an ally of former Sangh coworker and VHP state chief  Praveen Togadia  from his  cabinet . When the BKS staged a farmers demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from stateprovided houses and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in  Gandhinagar  deepened the rift with the VHP. 115 116  Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modis administrative decisions. 115  His 200207 changes have led to Gujarats description as an attractive investment destination. According to Aditi Phadnis There was sufficient anecdotal evidence pointing to the fact that corruption had gone down significantly in the state... if there was to be any corruption Modi had to know about it. 65  He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007  Vibrant Gujarat  summit realestate investment deals worth   6.6trillion were signed in the state. 65  Despite his secondterm focus on economic issues Modis relationship with Muslims continued to be criticised. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister 117 118  distanced himself reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the  2004 Lok Sabha elections . After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJPs electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. 119 120  2007 election  Further information  Gujarat Legislative Assembly election 2007  During the runup to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election the BJP ramped up its rhetoric on terrorism. 121  On 18 July 2006 Modi criticised Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  ... for his reluctance to revive antiterror legislation such as the 2002  Prevention of Terrorism Act . He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the  2006 Mumbai blasts 122  and demanded the execution of  Afzal Guru  123  a collaborator with Pakistani jihadists who was convicted of terrorism for his involvement in the  2001 Indian Parliament attack . 124 b  After the November  2008 Mumbai attacks  Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarats 1600kilometre 990milong coastline resulting in  government  authorisation of 30 highspeed surveillance boats. 125  In July 2007 Modi completed 2063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat making him the longestserving holder of that post 126  and the BJP won 122 of 182 stateassembly seats in that years election. 127  Third term 200712  Projects      Sardar Sarovar Dam  during a 2006 height increase.    Keshubhai Patel and Modis BJP governments supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwaterconservation projects according to Tushaar Shah Gujarat a semiarid state was ... never known for agrarian dynamism. By December 2008 500000 structures were built of which 113738 were  check dams . While most checkdam impoundments dried up during the  premonsoon period  they helped monsoon rains recharge the  aquifers  beneath them. 128  Sixty of the 112  tehsils  which were found to have depleted the  water table  in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010 129  and Gujarat increased its groundwater levels when they were falling in all other Indian states. As a result the states production of genetically modified  Bt cotton  which could now be irrigated with  tube wells  increased to become the largest in India. 128  The boom in cotton production and its semiarid land use 130  saw Gujarats agricultural growth increase to 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. 131  Although public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat such as the  Sardar Sarovar Dam  have been less successful 128  from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural  growth rate  of 10.97 percent  the highest of any state. 130  However sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 199297 INC government was 12.9 percent. 132     Modi at a hospital dedication in  Kheda district  2013.    The Modi government brought electricity to every village in Gujarat although according to Dipankar Banerjee all but 170 villages had been electrified under the INC administration. 132  Modi significantly changed the states system of power distribution greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the  Jyotigram Yojana  scheme in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised 128  according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. 133  Progress was made on the  Gujarat International Finance TecCity  project considered one of Modis pet projects. Its first phase consisting of two skyscrapers GIFT One and Two was completed in 2012. 134 135  He celebrated the year 2012 as Swami Vivekanandas 150th anniversary year in Gujarat. 38  Development debate     Modi addressing graduates at  Gujarat National Law University  2012.    Modis administration branded Gujarat as a state of dynamic development economic growth and prosperity with the slogan Vibrant Gujarat. 84 136 137  Scholars have stated that Gujarats rate of economic growth had been high even before Modis tenure and did not accelerate after he came to power. 138  During Modis tenure as Chief Minister Gujarat topped the World Banks ease of doing business rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. 139  In 2013 Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for economic freedom by a report measuring governance growth citizens rights and labour and business regulation among the countrys 20 largest states. 140  However critics have pointed to its relatively poor record on human development poverty relief nutrition and education. Gujarat ranks 13th in India in poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five are underweight and 23 percent are undernourished putting the state in the alarming category on the  India State Hunger Index . 141  In a review of the 1894  Land Acquisition Act  the Supreme Court of India identified Gujarat as one of the few states from which there were no complaints of forcible land acquisition. 142  According to political scientist  Christophe Jaffrelot  development in Gujarat has been limited to the urban middle class as rural residents and the lower castes have become increasingly marginalised. The state ranks 10th of the 21 Indian states in the  Human Development Index  which he attributes to less rural development. Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural  adivasi  and  dalits  in particular have declined. 143  In July 2013 economics Nobel Laureate  Amartya Sen  expressed disapproval of Modis governance record saying that under his administration Gujarats record in education and healthcare is pretty bad. 144  However economists  Arvind Panagariya  and  Jagdish Bhagwati  say that Gujarats social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them Gujarats performance in raising  literacy  rates has been superior to other states and the rapid improvement of health indicators is evidence that its progress has not been poor by any means. 145  Fourth term 201214     Modi with  Anandiben Patel  at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.    Further information  Gujarat Legislative Assembly election 2012  In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86373 votes over Shweta Bhatt the INC candidate and wife of  Sanjiv Bhatt . 146  The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats continuing its majority during his tenure 147  and allowing the party to form the government as it had in Gujarat since 1995. 148  In later byelections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. 149  In 2013 the  Wharton India Economic Forum  WIEF at the  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania  cancelled a keynote videoconference speech by Modi following protests by IndianAmericans. 150  After his election as prime minister Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from  Maninagar  on 21 May 2014.  Anandiben Patel  succeeded him as the chief minister. 151  International diplomacy  To attract foreign investment to Gujarat when he was chief minister Modi visited China Singapore and Japan 152  travelling to China in November 2006 to study the countrys  special economic zones  about to be implemented in Gujarat 153  September 2007 154  and November 2011. A month after his 2011 visit the  Chinese government  released 13 Indian diamond traders charged with smuggling in  Shenzhen  with Modi attributing their release to his diplomacy and statesmanship. 155 156  His relationship with many Western nations was troubled during his tenure as chief minister with questions about his role in the 2002 riots resulting in travel bans to the UK the US and the EU. Modi was barred from entering the United States under a provision of the  Immigration and Nationality Act  banning violators of religious freedom 157  the only person  denied a US visa  under this provision. 158  The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India the UK 159  and the EU 160  lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013 respectively and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. 161 162     Modi meeting the South Korean ambassador in Gandhinagar in 2013.    Regarding the United States of America U.S. on 16 March 2005 Rep. Conyers and Rep. Pitts in the U.S. House of Representatives in Congress submitted H.RES.160 banning  Narendra Modi  the Chief Minister of the State of  Gujarat  in  India  from entering the U.S. indefinitely. The title of the document is Condemning the conduct of Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his actions to incite religious persecution and urging the United States to condemn all violations of religious freedom in India. The document contains this quote Whereas the USCIRF has confirmed in its May 2004 report that the state government in Gujarat led by Chief Minister Modi has been widely accused of being reluctant to bring the perpetrators of the killings of Muslims and nonHindus to justice. 163 164  On 16 May 2014 Narendra Modi was elected the  15th Prime Minister of India  in the largest Democratic election ever held on Earth. 165  On 14 June 2014 Senator Barbara Boxer DCalifornia and nine of her colleagues in the U.S. Senate sent a joint letter to newly elected Prime Minister Modi with the following title Boxer Colleagues Urge Indian Prime Minister to Improve Safety of Women in India. 166  On 8 June 2016 Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress. 167 168  In 2011 the  Karachi Chamber of Commerce  Industry  impressed with development in Gujarat invited Modi to visit Pakistan and address business leaders who asked him to consider a flight between Ahmedabad and  Karachi  because of the cultural and economic relationships between Gujarat and  Sindh . Modi wanted to ease Pakistans power crisis particularly in Sindh and suggested that the country could follow the examples of the Gujarat model set by  Gujarat Solar Park  and the  Kalpasar Project . 169  In an April 2014 statement described as unexpected senior Pakistani diplomats told  The Daily Telegraph  that Modi was their choice for Indias prime Minister as he could provide the strong leadership necessary for peace talks. 170  Modi visited Japan in 2012. According to Ryohei Kasai research fellow at the Center for South Asian Studies at  Gifu Womens University  There is a growing interest in Modi in Japan with much anticipation that he will reshape India by revitalising its economy and better governance. I believe Japan has an excellent relationship with him. Not only have successive Japanese ambassadors to India been regular guests in Vibrant Gujarat investors summit organised biennially but Japanese private companies also made a big amount of investment in the state. 171  2014 Indian general election  Main article  Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election 2014     Modi addressing a rally in  Meerut  during the  2014 general election campaign .    On 31 March 2013 Modi was appointed to the BJP parliamentary board the highest decisionmaking body in the party 172 173  and at a meeting of the partys national executive on 9 June he was appointed chair of the BJPs central election campaign committee for the 2014 general election. 172 174  BJP founding member  L. K. Advani  resigned his party posts after the appointment citing concern with leaders who were concerned with their personal agendas. His resignation which was described as being a protest against Modis elevation was withdrawn the following day at the urging of RSS chief  Mohan Bhagwat . 175  In September 2013 the BJP announced that the chief minister would be their candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. 174 176  Other BJP leaders also initially expressed opposition to Modis candidature. 172  Modis nomination also drew attention for his reputation as one of contemporary Indias most controversial and divisive politicians. 177  Modi played a dominant role in the BJPs 2009 generalelection campaign. 178 179  Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the primeministerial candidate they would have voted for another party. 180  The BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions. 172 174 177 180 181  The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. 172 182  The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi. 177  During the campaign Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. 172 177  Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about development without focus on any specific policies. 172  His message found support among young Indians and among middleclass citizens. 177  The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modis commitment to  secularism  areas in which he had previously received criticism. 177  Prior to the election Modis image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modis neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. 179  Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. 172 180 183  Through the campaign the BJP received significantly more positive media coverage than its competitors particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. Commentators attributed this to Modis influence in the area. 184  The campaign also made extensive use of advertising in vernacular media sources portraying Modi as the victim of a news media conspiracy among the English language sources. 179  However the BJPs campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. 185  Modis campaign blitz cost approximately INR 5000 crores 830 million 177  and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. 185  In addition to more conventional campaign methods such as rallies and the use of print media Modi also made extensive use of social media 172 177  and addressed more than 1000 rallies via  hologram  appearances. 183  The election was described as Indias first social media election. 186  The BJP won 31 of the vote 187  and more than doubled its tally in the  Lok Sabha  to 282 and became the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. 179 180  The results were described as a proModi wave. 177 180  Voter unhappiness with the INC as well as with regional parties in North India was another reason for the success of the BJP. 180  The support network of the RSS played a role in Modis success. 172  Scholars studying the election also stated that Modi had an ability to attract supporters who would campaign for him thus strengthening his position as a candidate but making the partys victory relatively fragile. 172 174  In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well it drew exceptionally high support from uppercaste Hindus. 180  It won only 10 percent of the Muslim vote which was nonetheless more than it had won before. 180  It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. 180  The magnitude of the BJPs victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the rightwing BJP. 177 180 188 189  Modis tweet announcing his victory in the election was the most retweeted in India 190  and was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a  Nehruvian  secular socialist state towards capitalism and  Hindu cultural nationalism . 190  Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies Varanasi and  Vadodara . 191  He won in both constituencies defeating  Aam Aadmi Party  leader  Arvind Kejriwal  in Varanasi and  Madhusudan Mistry  of the INC in Vadodara by 570128 votes. 192  The BJPled NDA won the general election overall and the INC experienced its worstever defeat. 193 194 195  Modi who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP after his partys victory was appointed prime minister by Indias president. 196 197  To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency he vacated the Vadodara seat. 198  Prime Minister 2014present     Wikinews has related news  Narendra Modi elected new Prime Minister of India.

The affidavit was filed in the court on Thursday on the basis of findings of Special Investigation Team SIT appointed by the Supreme Court challenging anticipatory bail given to Kodnani by the lower court. She was the leader of mob and was an MLA and allegations against her is she was instigating the mob to commit crime and therefore she was playing the main role the affidavit said. The copy of the affidavit is with PTI. The affidavit said from one of the statements of witnesses it has been revealed that she had fired from her pistol as well as from another statement it has been revealed that she had come to the spot in a car with other persons and had distributed swords among the mob. Kodnani is a Minister of State for Higher Education in the Gujarat government and is regularly attending the ongoing Assembly session. Kodnani had gone underground after SIT declared her absconder and resurfaced only after the lower court granted anticipatory bail to her. The affidavit said she is a minister in the present government so there are ample chances of tampering with prosecution witnesses by way of giving threat. It has said that about 15 witness have testified that a mob of around 15000 people was headed by Kodnani and she was instigating the mob. Speaking about the lower court order the affidavit says that lower court had passed the order of giving anticipatory bail to Kodnani without appreciating the affidavit placed on record by the prosecution and without considering the papers of the investigation. The lower courts order granting anticipatory bail to Kodnani said that it is proved that she was part of the mob but anticipatory bail was given to her on basis of parity as others who were part of the mob have been given bail. The matter of anticipatory bail of Kodnani came up for hearing on Thursday but Justice A S Dave of the Gujarat High Court declined to hear the petition saying not before me. Now the matter will come up for hearing in front of Justice D H Vaghela on February 24. Over 95 people belonging to the minority community were killed and their properties destroyed in Naroda Patia and Naroda Gam by a mob on February 28 2002 following the Godhra train buring incident.

I would say that the assessment on our part is that the PMs visit was extraordinarily successful. It has provided a boost in terms of the vision and focus that we have for our bilateral relations  Phil Reiner  senior director for India at the  National Security Council  at the  White House  said on Thursday. The briefing was organized less than 48 hours after Modis departure from the US and this itself signifies outcome of the trip.       We are excited to be moving forward with a reenergised strategic partnership. The US continues to strongly support a prosperous India that plays an important role in the global stage and I think the PMs visit really provided the opportunity for the two leaders to discuss that vision thats necessary in order to set the framework Reiner claimed.       I think the two leaders had a very positive conversation not only about our own bilateral relationship but the relationship that PM Modi is interested in developing with Pakistan Reiner informed.       Hailing the efforts made by the Modi government to improve ties with Pakistan Reiner said I think that everyone saw with the invitation that was extended to Pakistans leader to come to New Delhi for the inauguration I think theres a great interest on the Indian side to see that relationship grow and move in the right direction. That was the gist of the conversation.

The result will be seen in recent time. nv Groups   NY   IMHO there is a lot of hype and PR. Not much coverage for this Indian leader in 2014 as done to others in earlier years. There was a cursory mention though. Ashish Nigam   Pune   I wish our own opposition parties accept it. They had been harping over and over again for last one week claiming Modis USA visit was waste.

The prominent economist also criticised Modis model of governance saying he did not approve of it. Yes I dont want him Sen told a news channel in reply to a question on whether he wanted him as his prime minister. As an Indian citizen I dont want Modi as my PM. He has not done enough to make minorities feel safe he said. On being asked why he did not want so Sen said He could have first of all been more secular and he could have made the minority community feel more secure. No I dont approve of it... I dont think the record is very good. I think I dont have to be a member of the minority in order to feel insecure... We Indians dont want a situation where the minority feel insecure and could legitimately think that there was an organised violence against them in 2002. I think that is a terrible record and I dont think Indian Prime Minister as an Indian citizen... Of who has that kind of record. No I do not. Sen said physical infrastructure in Gujarat may be good but Modi has not done enough for minorities or for the majority. He also said that the Gujarat model needs to do much more on the health and education sectors and bring equity. He said Modi could have made the majority community feel that they are not maltreating the minority and going against the long Indian tradition of being tolerant. He could have also taken both of the facts that Gujarat record in education and healthcare is pretty bad and he has to concentrate on that...as much as he is concentrating quietly as it has happened on physical infrastructure the Nobel laureate said. BJP recently anointed Modi as chairman of its election campaign committee.

The verdict of the judiciary should be honoured SP general secretary Amar Singh told reporters on Monday. It is for the government to reveal as to why it has yet not hanged Afzal Guru. Singhs statement came after Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh asserted that Guru should be hanged. The ruling Congress had until recently been evasive on its stand on Afzals death sentence. The Congress has no sympathies whatsoever for terrorists. Afzal should be hanged. There is no doubt about it AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh had said in Madhya Pradesh. The statement by both the leaders holds significance in view of the fact that Opposition BJP has been campaigning against the ruling Congress accusing the latter of being soft on terror. The SP has also come under attack from the BJP after it demanded a judicial probe into the Jamia Nagar police encounter that followed serial terror attacks in Delhi. The BJP had called the SPs demand a dishonour to the police officer Mohan Chand Sharma who was killed in the operation. The BJP has also long demanded that Afzal be executed. Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi made it one of his pet election lines and L K Advani has said that if elected his government would carry out the death sentence if Afzal doesnt get clemency. The Congress has always retaliated by reminding the BJP of its mistake in releasing terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar in exchange for the crew and passengers of the hijacked IC814 at Kandahar in 1999.  Amar Singh meanwhile continued his tirade against the Government for harassment of minorities across the country pointing to recent incidents of violence in Congressruled Assam Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.Even during the rule of Congress the minorities are being harassed. Being a supporter of the Government it is our duty to raise the issue in public to sensitise the Government said Amar Singh. ... contd.

But Jashodaben 62 a retired school teacher who was married to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi when she was 17 and separated after about three years is far removed from the rough and tumble of politics. She gets a monthly pension of Rs 14000 lives mostly with a brother and spends much of her time in prayer. In Ahmedabad to visit her extended family she agreed to be interviewed by The Indian Express but refused to be photographed. Excerpts from her first interview since Modi was named PM candidate For how long were you married and what is the status of the marriage   We married when I was 17... I had quit studies once I went to his place and remember him saying he wanted me to pursue my education. He would mostly talk to me about completing my education. Initially he took interest in talking to me and even in the affairs of the kitchen. Do you feel burdened by the relationship especially when the media asks you about your strained relationship Are you instructed to remain low profile  We have never been in touch and we parted on good terms as there were never any fights between us. I will not make up things that are not true. In three years we may have been together for all of three months. There has been no communication from his end to this day. Do you track the news about Narendra Modi  Yes I read everything that I can get my hands on. I read all the newspaper articles and also watch news on the television and like to read about him. If he becomes the next Prime Minister and moves to Delhi would you like to go back to him if he calls you back Will you try and meet him   I have never gone to meet him and we have never been in touch. I dont think he will ever call me. In whatever I say I do not want it to harm him. I just wish that he I like to read about him... I know he will become PM. Modi progresses in whatever he does. I know he will become PM one day Did he ever tell you he was leaving you or quitting the marriage   He told me once that I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please what will you do following me When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family he told me why did you come to your inlaws house when you are still so young you must instead focus on pursuing your studies. The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished I told him I would like to join him. However on many occasions when I went to my inlaws place he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my fathers house. Are you still legally Modis wife  Every time people take his name I am also mentioned somewhere even though in the background. Did you not come all the way and look all over to find me and come and speak to me If I was not his wife would you have come to speak to me Do you feel slighted that your status as a wife has not been acknowledged by him in all these years   No. I dont feel bad because I know that he is doing so due to destiny and bad times. In such situations he has to say such things and also has to lie. I dont see my situation as being bad because I feel in a way my luck has improved too. Why have you never remarried   After this experience I dont think I want to. My heart is not into it. How did you support yourself after you moved back to your parents house   My inlaws treated me well but would never speak about the marriage. My father paid the fees for my studies and I also got some financial assistance from my brothers to continue my education. I had lost my mother when I was two years old and I lost my father two years after I started studying again and was in class 10. However once I started my studies I started to enjoy learning and did my SSC in 1974 and went on to complete my teachers training in 1976 and became a teacher in 1978. How do you spend your retired days   I enjoyed teaching and taught classes from the first to fifth grade and taught all subjects. Nowadays I mostly start my day by 4 am and begin with prayers to Ambe Ma Goddess Durga. I spend all my time in Bhakti prayer. I mostly live with my elder brother Ashok Modi who lives in Unjha but I keep visiting the home of my other brother who lives in Brahman Vada near Unjha whenever I feel like. I feel I have got good brothers who have supported me.

Somehow intentions and activities must be synchronised otherwise the tensions will increase.    APR 21MAY 21  TAURUS   It is unfortunate that the spirit of the times seems to be narrowminded and belligerent. People everywhere are erecting ideologies and isms which have nothing to do with reality. Only you can put the world to rights by dismissing such fantasies.    MAY 22JUNE 21  GEMINI   It is within the Moons power to raise selfdoubt within the Geminian mind and emotions. This is all to the good if it causes you to question some of your more complacent assumptions. A word of advice in your romantic relationships dont be too pushy.    JUNE 22JULY 23  CANCER   It will be impossible to get any sense out of partners who contradict themselves at every turn. However if you listen carefully you will discern the kernel of truth which will help you work out what theyre really trying to say and what theyre likely to do.     JULY 24AUG 23  LEO   These are not easy times. Many people are disillusioned in the face of the new realism. You can do your bit by beavering away behind the scenes putting your own interests in second place and quietly helping other people along and hopefully saving some money in the process.    AUG 24SEPT 23  VIRGO   The Moons occupation of a practical region of your solar chart completes a series of helpful alignments. The only question is do you have the skill or vision necessary to seize your many opportunities The answer is that you do but only if you stick to tried and tested methods.     SEPT 24OCT 23  LIBRA   Its time for a tough choice at home yet so unstable are the general planetary alignments that its impossible to anticipate the consequences. You may therefore have no choice but to take a leap in the dark. Its all a matter of confidence and of realising that if something goes wrong you can put it right.    OCT 24NOV 22  SCORPIO   There are moments when the intense serious deep brooding Scorpio comes into his or her own. Now is one such time and if you make the right moves you will stand head and shoulders above the general melee. A social prize or personal goal which you were once denied will soon be offered again.    NOV 23DEC 22  SAGITTARIUS   Your continuing financial fortunes can be plotted by the passage of the Moon. Now we can see that the zodiac rewards hard work and that your past efforts are about to result in greater prosperity. Your mind clicks into top gear next week so hang on till then.     DEC 23JAN 20  CAPRICORN   Important planets are polarised in your chart and you are caught between the two extremes of deep Saturnine caution and ambitious Jupiterian optimism. This is then a day to make significant choices. You would do well to rely on your cautious personal skills and avoid reckless decisions.    JAN 21FEB 19  AQUARIUS   A number of developments are taking place which are difficult to understand or place in context. Yet your stars reveal that you are being pushed towards a phase of much greater domestic stability and hence emotional certainty. And that has to be the best possible news.    FEB 20MAR 20  PISCES   Many Pisceans are political animals anxious to get stuck in and tell other people how to live their lives. If you havent so far become involved in community activities do so now. It will be a perfect way to live out the noble selfsacrificing parts of your personality.

Somehow intentions and activities must be synchronised otherwise the tensions will increase.    APR 21MAY 21  TAURUS   It is unfortunate that the spirit of the times seems to be narrowminded and belligerent. People everywhere are erecting ideologies and isms which have nothing to do with reality. Only you can put the world to rights by dismissing such fantasies.    MAY 22JUNE 21  GEMINI   It is within the Moons power to raise selfdoubt within the Geminian mind and emotions. This is all to the good if it causes you to question some of your more complacent assumptions. A word of advice in your romantic relationships dont be too pushy.    JUNE 22JULY 23  CANCER   It will be impossible to get any sense out of partners who contradict themselves at every turn. However if you listen carefully you will discern the kernel of truth which will help you work out what theyre really trying to say and what theyre likely to do.     JULY 24AUG 23  LEO   These are not easy times. Many people are disillusioned in the face of the new realism. You can do your bit by beavering away behind the scenes putting your own interests in second place and quietly helping other people along and hopefully saving some money in the process.    AUG 24SEPT 23  VIRGO   The Moons occupation of a practical region of your solar chart completes a series of helpful alignments. The only question is do you have the skill or vision necessary to seize your many opportunities The answer is that you do but only if you stick to tried and tested methods.     SEPT 24OCT 23  LIBRA   Its time for a tough choice at home yet so unstable are the general planetary alignments that its impossible to anticipate the consequences. You may therefore have no choice but to take a leap in the dark. Its all a matter of confidence and of realising that if something goes wrong you can put it right.    OCT 24NOV 22  SCORPIO   There are moments when the intense serious deep brooding Scorpio comes into his or her own. Now is one such time and if you make the right moves you will stand head and shoulders above the general melee. A social prize or personal goal which you were once denied will soon be offered again.    NOV 23DEC 22  SAGITTARIUS   Your continuing financial fortunes can be plotted by the passage of the Moon. Now we can see that the zodiac rewards hard work and that your past efforts are about to result in greater prosperity. Your mind clicks into top gear next week so hang on till then.     DEC 23JAN 20  CAPRICORN   Important planets are polarised in your chart and you are caught between the two extremes of deep Saturnine caution and ambitious Jupiterian optimism. This is then a day to make significant choices. You would do well to rely on your cautious personal skills and avoid reckless decisions.    JAN 21FEB 19  AQUARIUS   A number of developments are taking place which are difficult to understand or place in context. Yet your stars reveal that you are being pushed towards a phase of much greater domestic stability and hence emotional certainty. And that has to be the best possible news.    FEB 20MAR 20  PISCES   Many Pisceans are political animals anxious to get stuck in and tell other people how to live their lives. If you havent so far become involved in community activities do so now. It will be a perfect way to live out the noble selfsacrificing parts of your personality.
